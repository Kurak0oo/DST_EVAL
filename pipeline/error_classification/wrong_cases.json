The model seems to over-rely on previous predictions without adequately verifying them against the current user input, which only specifies a preference for 'chinese' food.

In this case, the model predicted 'africa' instead of 'african' for the 'restaurant-food' slot. This suggests that the model may not be effectively distinguishing between different forms of words or understanding the context in which they are used. Such errors can occur when the model's training data does not sufficiently cover variations in language or when the model lacks the ability to generalize across different but semantically similar terms.
