### Background:
In the following examples, you will receive **Current Prediction** (from the DST model) and **Ground Truth** (from MultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.4) for "Current Dialouge". Your task is to analyze the **error** of **Current Prediction**, NOT the **Prediction History** with the help of information in **Current Dialogue** and **Dialogue History** 

### Instructions:
Please **categorize the error** in a **generalized** way. Your response should focus on **why** this error might have occurred from a **higher-level perspective**. Specifically, focus on the broader causes of the error, and explain them without getting into trivial details or specific slot-value mismatches.

Your analysis should:
1. **Categorize** the error in a **broad** error type with **as much general details of why this error occur**.
2. **Explain** the broader reasons behind this type of error.

### Dialogue History:
{history}

### Current Dialogue:
System:{system}
User:{user}

### Current Prediction:
{turn_label}

### Prediction History:
{predict_history}

### Ground Truth (M21):
{ground_truth_turn_label_m21}

### Ground Truth (M24):
{ground_truth_turn_label_m24}

**Please categorize the errors which could explain the broader causes of the error, its potential sources, and general patterns. Avoid focusing on specific slot-value errors, but provide insights that could apply to a wide range of situations and help guide future improvements for DST models.**

### Output Format:
{{
  "judgement": "[Correct] or [Wrong]",
  "error_category": "[Broad Context or Area] caused by [Specific Cause or Factor], which leads to [Impact or Consequence]",
  "error_description": "[A high-level detailed explanation of the error]"
}}

Notice:
1,Do not output anything other than the Judgement when considering predictions be Correct
2,Your task is to analyze the **error** of **Current Prediction**, NOT the **Prediction History**, but **Prediction History** could have impact on your Judgement
