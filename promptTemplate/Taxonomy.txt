- Inflexibility in Slot Matching and Lack of Semantic Understanding
- Over-Penalization of Minor Slot Differences in Evaluation
- Ambiguities in Ground Truth and Labeling Inconsistencies]

**2. Error Description**:
[A high-level summary of the error that avoids focusing on specific slot-value mismatches. The explanation should emphasize why the error happened from a broad perspective.]
