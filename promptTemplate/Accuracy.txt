# Dialogue History:
{history}

# Current Turn:
{{
"Agent": {system},
"User": {user},
"State of this turn": {turn_label}
}}

# Instruction:
Your task is to identify and analyze **incorrect domain-slot, value pairs** in the belief state of the current dialogue turn. For each incorrect domain-slot, value pair in the belief state:
-Provide an explanation of why the identified domain-slot, value pair is incorrect. Include specific reasons based on the current turn.
-Extract **exact sentences or phrases** from the current turn (System or User) that indicate the incorrectness of the domain-slot, value pair or why it does not match the expected value.


# Potential incorrect cases:
-Incorrect Values
Explanation: Predicted values do not align with the user's requests, dialogue history, or intent.
Examples: Assigning train-leaveat to train-arriveby and vice versa.
-Partial or Misinterpreted Matches
Explanation: Predicted value partially or incorrectly matches the user intent but misses the full or correct information.
Examples: Predicting "abbey pool" instead of "abbey pool and astroturf pitch."
-Over-Inclusion and Invalid Slot Predictions
Explanation: Inclusion of irrelevant, unsupported, or unnecessary slot predictions based on the dialogue context.
Examples: Including an invalid slot like taxi-book stay.
-Incorrect Handling of 'Dontcare' Values
Explanation: Misinterpreting "dontcare" intent, leading to predictions with specific values instead of expressing indifference.
Examples: Predicting a specific value for hotel-area or restaurant-area when the user has not indicated a preference.
-Concatenation or Splitting Errors
Explanation: Incorrectly combining or separating slot values, resulting in improper slot structure.
Examples:Combining train-departure and train-destination as one value.
