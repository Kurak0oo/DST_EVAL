DST prediction data was selected by the SVAG then compared with MultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.4 labels
Evaluation data was then collected with the judgement by GPT4 in different templates
By considering MultiWOZ 2.4 as the golden standard, we could examine the performance of DST models, in this case, the SVAG
Evaluation false was collected through the inconsistency between prediction and the MultiWOZ 
Learning process then taken place to categorize the errors, providing the final error taxonomy with human-in-loop modifications
