DST prediction data was selected by the SVAG then compared with MultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.4 labels
By considering MultiWOZ 2.4 as the golden standard, we could examine the performance of DST models, in this case, the SVAG
Evaluation results were collected through the different prompt template via GPT-4
Learning process then taken place to categorize the errors, providing the final error taxonomy with human-in-loop modifications
